## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Background Service Worker** (`src/background.js`): Handles price fetching, alerts, and scheduling
- **Content Script** (`src/content.js`): Adds tracking buttons to RuneScape pages
- **Popup Interface** (`src/popup/popup.html`, `src/popup/popup.js`): Main user interface
- **Settings Page** (`src/settings/settings.html`, `src/settings/settings.js`): Configuration interface

### Price Fetching Technology

The extension uses advanced web scraping techniques to extract real-time prices:

1. **Primary Method**: Parses JavaScript `average30.push()` arrays containing current pricing data
2. **Fallback Method**: Analyzes script content for price-range numbers (1k - 10B gp)  
3. **Text Parsing**: Extracts "Current Guide Price" with K/M/B multiplier support
4. **Error Handling**: Robust fallback systems ensure reliable data extraction

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Chrome's `storage.local` API for watchlist data
- **Sync Storage**: Chrome's `storage.sync` API for settings (syncs across devices)
- **No External Servers**: All data remains on your device
- **Persistent**: Data survives browser restarts and updates

### Permissions Explained

- `activeTab`: Read content from the current RuneScape tab
- `storage`: Save watchlist and settings data locally
- `notifications`: Show desktop price alert notifications  
- `alarms`: Schedule background price checks
- `https://secure.runescape.com/*`: Access official RuneScape Grand Exchange pages

### Performance

- **Efficient Scheduling**: Uses Chrome's alarm API for precise timing
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids unnecessary requests with intelligent caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful request patterns to avoid server overload
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic for failed price fetches

## üéØ Usage Examples

2. Set Low Alert: `9,800` (buying opportunity)
3. Set High Alert: `10,800` (selling opportunity)  
4. Wait for notifications and execute trades

### Example 2: Long-term Investment Monitoring

**Goal**: Track expensive items for investment timing

1. Add items like Party Hats, Rares, or high-tier equipment
2. Set alerts 5-10% below/above current prices
3. Monitor long-term trends for investment decisions

### Example 3: Resource Management

**Goal**: Buy supplies when cheap for skilling

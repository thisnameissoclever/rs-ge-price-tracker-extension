## Technical Details

### Files Structure

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `src/background.js` - Background service worker for price checking and notifications
- `src/content.js` - Content script that runs on RuneScape item pages
- `src/popup/popup.html` - Extension popup interface

### Permissions

### Data Storage

- All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- No data is sent to external servers
- Your watchlist persists between browser sessions

## Current Limitations

- **Price Fetching**: The current implementation includes placeholder code for price fetching. To make it fully functional, you would need to implement one of these approaches:
  - Use RuneScape's official API (if available)
  - Implement web scraping of item pages
  - Use a third-party RuneScape price API
  - Parse price data from the item pages directly

- **Price Update Frequency**: Currently set to check every 5 minutes, but actual price updates depend on the implementation of the price fetching mechanism
